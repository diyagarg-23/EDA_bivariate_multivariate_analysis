# EDA with Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
This repository documents my learning experience on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques, based on a YouTube tutorial.

# Notebooks
1) Without Pipelines: This notebook covers the basic workflow without using pipelines, utilizing Numpy, Pandas, and Pickle for data manipulation and model serialization.
2) Predict Without Pipelines: Demonstrates the prediction process without pipelines, using Pickle and Numpy for model loading and prediction.
3) Using Pipelines: Introduces the use of pipelines for a streamlined workflow, employing Numpy, Pandas, and Pickle.
4) Predict With Pipelines: Shows how to make predictions using pipelines, leveraging Pickle and Numpy for model loading and prediction within a pipeline structure.

# Dataset
The project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to illustrate the concepts.

# Installation
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
